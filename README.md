# Link Unlocker - Filecrypt

Link Unlocker is a Tampermonkey userscript that makes dealing with Filecrypt containers much easier.  
Instead of clicking every single download button, it collects all the links for you and shows them in one simple box with a copy button.

It uses a small Node.js proxy server to decrypt .dlc files via [dcrypt.it](https://dcrypt.it/), because browsers canâ€™t upload files directly to their API due to CORS restrictions.  
The proxy handles the upload and sends the results back to the script.  
Setting it up yourself is easy: copy over `server.js`, install the dependencies and update the `UPLOAD_URL` in the script.  
You can keep it running with pm2 or any other process manager.
